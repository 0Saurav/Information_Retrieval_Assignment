- `crawler.py` – Crawls web pages to collect news/publication data.  
- `indexer.py` – Creates an inverted index from crawled data.  
- `query_processor.py` – Handles search queries and returns results.

### Task 2: Classifier
- `scrape_data.py` – Scrapes RSS feeds for news data.  
- `train_model.py` – Trains different classifiers (TF-IDF, BERT, RF).  
- `preprocess.py` – Cleans and preprocesses text data.  
- `predict.py` – Makes predictions on new text using trained classifiers.  
- `data/` – Stores datasets and model files (large files excluded).
